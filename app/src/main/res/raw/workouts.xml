        <description>For time.

            If the century mark proves to be too much, scale the pull-ups and push-ups down to 60 reps. Aim to finish in 20 minutes for a respectable mark, according to WODcalculator.com.</description>

        <description>Every minute on the minute (EMOM) for 30 minutes.

            EMOM means that you'll perform a round of the exercises at the start of every minute, resting until the start of the next 60 seconds. That will get harder, and eventually you might not have any time to rest.</description>
